CrypRQ is a post-quantum, zero-trust VPN stack that couples ML-KEM (Kyber768-compatible) with X25519 over libp2p QUIC transport. The project emphasizes rapid key rotation, enforceable peer allowlists, and reproducible builds for high-assurance environments.

## What’s Inside
- Architecture overview spanning crypto, P2P coordination, and userspace WireGuard.
- Task-oriented guides for building, deploying, and operating CrypRQ.
- Security analysis, threat model, and disclosure process.

## Why CrypRQ
- Hybrid post-quantum handshake mitigates store-now-decrypt-later threats.
- Explicit peer trust: no implicit network assumptions.
- Deterministic build pipeline for supply-chain confidence.

# Final Post-Install Validation Checklist

**Run this before pressing the big green button** 

## 1⃣ Fast Sanity

```bash
./scripts/quick-smoke.sh || ./scripts/local-validate.sh
```

**Expected:**
-  Docker fake backend responds on :9464
-  Lint, typecheck, unit, E2E tests pass
-  Desktop artifacts built

## 2⃣ Observability and Telemetry Readiness

```bash
./scripts/observability-checks.sh
./scripts/sanity-checks.sh    # Answer 'y' for Check 6 to test flags/telemetry
```

**Expected:**
-  Structured logs (JSONL v1) found
-  Redaction OK (no secrets in logs)
-  Flags file valid JSON
-  Telemetry directory exists (if enabled)
-  Telemetry redaction OK (if enabled)

## 3⃣ Review PR Checklist or Create One Directly

```bash
gh pr create --fill --base main || echo "PR already open"
```

**Check PR includes:**
-  All tests passing
-  CI checks green
-  Artifacts attached (if applicable)
-  Changelog updated
-  Documentation updated

## 4⃣ (Optional) Trigger Full One-Shot Workflow

```bash
SHIP=true RUN_POST=true ./scripts/one-shot.sh --ship --post
```

**This runs:**
- Quick-smoke → Full validation (if needed)
- Branch + PR creation
- CI mirror trigger
- Ship (go-live + verify-release)
- Post-actions (observability + sanity)
- Cleanup

##  After Release (Live Ops)

### Golden Path (Manual Check)

**Desktop:** Connect → Charts ≤3s → Rotate (toast ≤2s) → Disconnect

**Mobile:** Settings → Report Issue → Share sheet (<2MB, "Report Prepared")

### Every 2 Hours for Day-0

```bash
./scripts/observability-checks.sh
./scripts/sanity-checks.sh
```

### If Telemetry Enabled

```bash
tail -f ~/.cryprq/telemetry/events-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl | grep event
```

**Watch for:**
- `connect` events (connection success)
- `rotation.completed` events (key rotations)
- `error` events (failures - investigate if spike)

---

##  Rollback (Emergency)

### Desktop

**Unmark "Latest" on GitHub release → re-promote prior stable tag**

1. Go to GitHub Releases
2. Find v1.1.0 release
3. Unmark "Latest" release
4. Re-promote previous stable version (e.g., v1.0.0)

### Mobile

**Pause rollout (Play Console) / expire build (TestFlight)**

**Android (Play Console):**
1. Open Play Console → Release → Production
2. Pause rollout
3. Revert to previous version if needed

**iOS (TestFlight):**
1. Open App Store Connect → TestFlight
2. Expire current build
3. Promote previous build if needed

---

##  Optional Enhancements (Future)

- **Integrate telemetry counters into a lightweight dashboard** (Prometheus → JSON bridge)
- **Add Slack webhook for sanity-check summaries**
- **Auto-attach OPERATOR_CHEAT_SHEET.txt to PRs via GH Action**

---

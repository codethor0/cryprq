# One-Shot Workflow

**End-to-end orchestration**: quick-smoke → validate → push/PR → (optional) ship → cleanup

## Usage

### Basic (validation + PR)

```bash
./scripts/one-shot.sh
```

### With Ship (after PR review)

```bash
SHIP=true ./scripts/one-shot.sh --ship
## Or
./scripts/one-shot.sh --ship
```

### With Post-Actions (observability + sanity)

```bash
RUN_POST=true ./scripts/one-shot.sh --post
## Or
./scripts/one-shot.sh --post
```

### Full Workflow

```bash
SHIP=true RUN_POST=true ./scripts/one-shot.sh --ship --post
```

## Steps

1. **Preconditions Check**
   - Docker running
   - Node.js 18+
   - Git available

2. **Quick-Smoke** (fast confidence)
   - Runs `./scripts/quick-smoke.sh`
   - Fast local sanity check

3. **Full Validation** (if quick-smoke failed)
   - Runs `./scripts/local-validate.sh`
   - Comprehensive validation

4. **Summarize Outputs**
   - Lists desktop artifacts
   - Lists reports

5. **Branch + PR** (idempotent)
   - Creates feature branch if on main/master
   - Commits changes
   - Pushes branch
   - Creates PR (if gh CLI available)

6. **CI Mirror** (optional)
   - Triggers `local-validate-mirror.yml` workflow
   - Aligns PR with local validation

7. **Ship** (optional, guarded)
   - Runs `./scripts/go-live.sh VERSION`
   - Runs `./scripts/verify-release.sh`
   - Only if `SHIP=true` or `--ship` flag

8. **Post-Actions** (optional)
   - Runs `./scripts/observability-checks.sh`
   - Runs `./scripts/sanity-checks.sh`
   - Only if `RUN_POST=true` or `--post` flag

9. **Cleanup**
   - Runs `./scripts/cleanup.sh`
   - Stops Docker containers
   - Cleans artifacts

## Output

The script prints a compact summary with:
- Current branch
- PR URL (if created)
- Artifact paths
- Reports paths
- Next suggested steps

## Acceptance Criteria

-  Docker fake backend responded on :9464 during tests
-  Lint, typecheck, unit, and Playwright E2E passed locally or in full validation
-  Desktop artifacts exist under `artifacts/desktop/<platform>/`
-  PR opened against main (if GH CLI available) and mirror CI kicked off
-  If shipped: release artifacts are signed/notarized and verify-release reported OK

## Golden Path (for PR testing)

**Connect → charts ≤3–5s → Rotate (toast ≤2s) → Disconnect**

## Monitoring (first 24h)

**Every 2h:**
```bash
./scripts/observability-checks.sh
./scripts/sanity-checks.sh
```

## Rollback

- **Desktop**: Unmark "Latest" release on GitHub
- **Mobile**: Pause rollout in Play Console / App Store Connect

## Example Output

Mobile: Settings → Report Issue → share sheet (<2MB, "Report Prepared")



Rollback (if needed)



Desktop: unmark v1.1.0 "Latest" on GitHub Release; re-promote prior stable



Mobile: pause Play rollout / expire TestFlight build



Pro tip (flags & telemetry—on demand)

# Kill features at runtime (no rebuild)

CRYPRQ_FLAGS='{"enableCharts":false,"enableTrayEnhancements":false}' npm run dev



# Turn on telemetry v0 only when ready (in-app toggle)

# Then tail:

tail -f ~/.cryprq/telemetry/events-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl

While the total number of entries in this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41717","epss":0.00617,"percentile":0.69096,"date":"2025-11-11"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41717","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.18.9","1.19.4"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.18.9","date":"2022-12-14","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.19.4","date":"2022-12-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.317755},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41717","versionConstraint":"< 1.18.9,>= 1.19.0, < 1.19.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.18.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0f2942c4136a7e01","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/gui/node_modules/app-builder-bin/mac/app-builder_arm64","accessPath":"/gui/node_modules/app-builder-bin/mac/app-builder_arm64","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29405","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29405","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/501224","https://go.dev/issue/60306","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1842","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/501224","https://go.dev/issue/60306","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1842","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241206-0003/"],"description":"The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo.

This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29403","epss":0.00009,"percentile":0.00662,"date":"2025-11-11"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29403","cwe":"CWE-668","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.10","1.20.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.10","date":"2023-06-16","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.5","date":"2023-06-16","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0068850000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-29403","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.10,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb41f4191fd69455","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/gui/node_modules/app-builder-bin/linux/ia32/app-builder","accessPath":"/gui/node_modules/app-builder-bin/linux/ia32/app-builder","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4674","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4674","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/686515","https://go.dev/issue/74380","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/gTNJnDXmn34","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3828","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/08/5"],"description":"The go command may execute unexpected commands when operating in untrusted VCS repositories.
